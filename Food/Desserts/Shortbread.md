## Ashley's Mom's Shortbread

### Ingredients
1 cup margarine
1 cup butter
1 cup chocolate chips (you can leave these out but who doesn't like chocolate, I mean really... :P)
1 cup icing sugar
1 cup white sugar
4 cups all purpose flour

### Directions

Cream together butter, margarine, and both sugars until light and fluffy. 
Mix in chocolate chips.
Add flour a little at a time (will be kinda loose and crumbly). 
Knead on a floured surface til it holds together in a ball, then roll out to 1 cm (eyeball it) thickness. Cut out cookies. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes til lightly golden. 

### Note

This recipe makes a LOT of cookies, but I know for a fact it halves really well. (Easy math there, too!)
